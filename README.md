 ## Python Flask Expert Assistant

### Problem Analysis
The problem at hand is to build a Flask application that provides information about football games airing on TV today in the user's country.

### Application Structure
The Flask application will consist of the following components:

#### HTML Files
- `index.html`: This will be the main page of the application. It will display a form for the user to select their country and a button to submit the form.
- `results.html`: This page will display the results of the user's query. It will list the football games that are airing on TV today in the user's country.

#### Routes
- `/`: This route will render the `index.html` page.
- `/results`: This route will handle the form submission from the `index.html` page. It will query an external API to retrieve the football game data and then render the `results.html` page with the results.

### HTML Files
#### index.html
This file will contain the following:

- A form with a dropdown menu for the user to select their country.
- A submit button to submit the form.

#### results.html
This file will contain the following:

- A list of the football games that are airing on TV today in the user's country.
- Each game will be displayed with the following information:
  - Game time
  - Teams playing
  - TV channel

### Routes
#### /
This route will render the `index.html` page.

#### /results
This route will handle the form submission from the `index.html` page. It will perform the following steps:

1. Retrieve the user's selected country from the form data.
2. Query an external API to retrieve the football game data for the user's country.
3. Render the `results.html` page with the results of the query.

### Conclusion
This design provides a simple and effective way to build a Flask application that provides information about football games airing on TV today in the user's country. The application is easy to use and can be easily customized to meet the needs of different users.
